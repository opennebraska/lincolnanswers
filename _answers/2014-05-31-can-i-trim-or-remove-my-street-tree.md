## A run down:

A “Street Tree” is any tree located in a city right-of-way such as parking strips (or “planting strips”) in front of homes and businesses, or traffic circles. These trees, though on city property, are required by law to be maintained by the property owner.

Neither the state nor its capital city of Lincoln has any special regulations or rules regarding tree removal on private property. The care and responsibility for trees on private property lies solely with the owner, meaning that financial payment to remove one will also fall on them. If the tree is overhanging a street or public roadway but lies behind a fence line, its care will need to be handled by the owner, not the city.
